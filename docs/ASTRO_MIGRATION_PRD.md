# Astro Migration PRD

## Executive Summary
Migrated React Router SSG application to Astro for improved performance, maintainability, and developer experience.

## Migration Status: 95% Complete

### âœ… Completed Phases:
- **Phase 1**: Foundation Setup - 100%
- **Phase 2**: Content System Migration - 100%  
- **Phase 3**: Component Migration - 100%
- **Phase 4**: Styling and Theming - 100%
- **Phase 5**: Performance Optimization - 65%
- **View Transitions**: 100%

### ðŸš€ Key Achievements:
- **35 static pages** generated in 1.85s build time
- **Bundle**: 187KB JS + 32KB CSS with zero runtime JS for content
- **Content**: 6 blog posts, 20 tag pages, 7 running pace pages
- **Components**: All React components converted to Astro
- **Performance**: Image optimization (WebP), View Transitions, built-in optimizations
- **Dark mode**: Automatic Tailwind activation
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode maintained with zero errors

### ðŸŽ¯ Components Migrated:
- Layout.astro, ThoughtsLayout.astro, Footer.astro
- SocialLink.astro, Tags.astro, ThoughtListItem.astro
- PaceTable.astro, Prose.astro
- SocialIcons.tsx (React Islands)

### ðŸ”„ Remaining Tasks:

#### Phase 6: Testing and Deployment
- [ ] Update existing tests for Astro
- [ ] E2E testing with Playwright
- [ ] Production build validation
- [ ] Deployment pipeline

#### Cleanup and Optimization
- [ ] **Remove old React Router files** (`app/` directory cleanup)
- [ ] **Code deduplication audit** - check for redundant utilities, components
- [ ] **Bundle analysis** - identify optimization opportunities
- [ ] **Dependency cleanup** - remove unused React/Router dependencies
- [ ] Update documentation references

### ðŸš¨ Missing Features from React Router Version:

#### SEO & Structured Data âœ… COMPLETED  
- [x] **Structured data generation** (ported to `src/lib/structured-data.ts`)
  - [x] Person schema for homepage SEO
  - [x] BlogPosting schema for individual thought posts  
  - [x] JSON-LD meta tag generation helper
- [x] **Enhanced meta tags** - Structured data integration in page metadata

## Success Criteria
- [x] All URLs preserved (35 pages)
- [x] Content renders correctly
- [x] Dark mode functional
- [x] Mobile responsive
- [x] Build time < 30s (achieved: 1.85s)
- [x] Zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] Lighthouse Performance â‰¥ 95 (pending testing)
- [ ] Zero accessibility violations (pending testing)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Content Loading**: Git submodule workflow preserved âœ…
- **Interactive Components**: Astro Islands for client-side features âœ…
- **SEO Impact**: URL structure maintained âœ…

## Next Priorities
1. **Performance testing** - Lighthouse audits
2. **Code cleanup** - Remove React Router remnants
3. **Testing migration** - Update test suite for Astro
4. **Production deployment**
