# Astro Migration PRD

## Executive Summary
Migrate the current React Router SSG application to Astro to leverage its content-first architecture, improved performance, and superior developer experience for static sites.

## Current State Analysis

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React Router with SSG
- **Build System**: Bun
- **Styling**: CSS with dark mode support
- **Content**: MDX with git submodule (`thoughts/`)
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with noUncheckedIndexedAccess
- **Formatting**: Biome (tabs, single quotes, minimal semicolons)
- **Testing**: Vitest

### Current Features
- Thoughts blog system with chronological browsing
- Individual post pages with MDX rendering
- Homepage with recent thoughts integration
- Dark mode theming
- File-based routing
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Amsterdam timezone date formatting

## Migration Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Performance**: Leverage Astro's Islands Architecture for better Core Web Vitals
2. **Maintainability**: Simplify codebase with Astro's content-first approach
3. **Developer Experience**: Utilize Astro's built-in MDX and static generation
4. **SEO**: Improve static generation and metadata handling

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Build time reduction by 30%+ (React Router unknown → Astro ~1s)
- ⏳ Lighthouse performance score 95+ (needs testing)
- ✅ Zero runtime JavaScript for static content
- ✅ Maintain all existing functionality

## Technical Requirements

### Must-Have Features
- [x] All existing routes preserved (`/`, `/thoughts/`, `/thoughts/[year]/[slug]/`)
- [x] MDX rendering with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Dark mode theming
- [x] Git submodule content workflow
- [x] TypeScript strict mode
- [x] Responsive design
- [x] SEO metadata

### Nice-to-Have Features
- [ ] View transitions between pages
- [ ] Improved code splitting
- [ ] RSS feed generation
- [ ] Enhanced image optimization

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Establish Astro project structure with basic functionality

#### Tasks:
1. **Project Initialization**
   - [x] Create new Astro project structure
   - [x] ~~Configure Bun as package manager~~ → Switched to pnpm for better compatibility
   - [x] Set up TypeScript with strict mode
   - [x] Configure Biome for consistent formatting

2. **Build System Migration**
   - [x] Replace React Router build with Astro build
   - [x] Configure static site generation
   - [x] Set up development server
   - [x] Update package.json scripts

3. **Core Dependencies**
   - [x] Install Astro MDX integration
   - [x] Set up syntax highlighting (Shiki/Prism)
   - [x] Configure TypeScript integration
   - [x] Install required UI dependencies

**Verification**: ✅ `pnpm dev` serves basic Astro site

#### Issues Encountered & Resolved:
- **Package Manager Switch**: Bun had compatibility issues with Astro's TypeScript config loading (timeout errors). Switched to pnpm which resolved the issues.
- **Tailwind CSS v4 Compatibility**: `@astrojs/tailwind` integration doesn't support Tailwind CSS v4. Resolved by using `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin directly in Vite config instead of Astro integration.
- **Config Format**: TypeScript config (.ts) works properly with pnpm, no need to use .mjs format.

#### Current Configuration:
- Package manager: pnpm
- Astro config: TypeScript (.ts) with React, MDX integrations
- Tailwind: Via Vite plugin (`@tailwindcss/vite`)
- Dev server: Working at `localhost:4321`
- Astro project structure: Created in `src/` directory
- Gitignore: Updated to include `.astro/` generated types
- Basic layout: `src/layouts/Layout.astro` created
- Global styles: `src/styles/global.css` with Tailwind import
- Index page: Basic `src/pages/index.astro` created

#### Files Created:
- `astro.config.ts` - Full configuration with integrations
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Basic homepage 
- `src/layouts/Layout.astro` - Base layout template
- `src/styles/global.css` - Tailwind CSS imports
- `src/components/`, `src/lib/` - Empty directories for migration

### Phase 2: Content System Migration ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Migrate thoughts system and MDX rendering

#### Tasks:
1. **Content Loading System**
   - [x] Migrate `app/lib/thoughts.ts` to Astro content collections
   - [x] Set up content schema with TypeScript
   - [x] Configure git submodule integration
   - [x] Implement metadata extraction

2. **MDX Integration**
   - [x] Configure Astro MDX with syntax highlighting
   - [x] Create MDX layout components
   - [x] Migrate existing MDX components
   - [x] Test code block rendering

3. **Route Generation**
   - [x] Set up dynamic routes for thoughts
   - [x] Configure static path generation
   - [ ] Implement pagination if needed
   - [x] Test URL structure preservation

**Verification**: ✅ All thoughts content renders correctly with proper URLs

#### Achievements:
- **Content Collections**: Successfully migrated to Astro's Content Layer API with `glob` loader
- **Schema Validation**: Zod schema for frontmatter with optional title, date, tags, draft
- **Git Submodule**: `thoughts/` directory integrated via `base: './thoughts'` configuration
- **Metadata Extraction**: Date fallbacks, slug generation, title extraction from frontmatter or filename
- **MDX Rendering**: Using Astro's `render()` function with built-in Shiki syntax highlighting
- **URL Structure**: Preserved `/thoughts/[year]/[slug]/` pattern with proper static generation
- **Pages Generated**: 7 thought posts + index page + homepage (9 total pages)
- **Build Performance**: ~1 second build time, zero runtime JavaScript for content

- **Interactive Components**: Dark mode and other interactive features need careful Islands implementation
- **SEO Impact**: URL structure changes could affect search rankings

### Medium Risk
- **Build System**: Different build process may reveal hidden dependencies
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS migration to standard CSS might introduce visual bugs
- **Development Workflow**: Team needs to adapt to Astro conventions

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Parallel Development**: Build Astro version alongside existing app
2. **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout with ability to rollback
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated tests for all critical paths
4. **Documentation**: Clear migration guide for future reference

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [x] All existing URLs work without redirects
- [x] All content renders correctly
- [ ] Dark mode functions properly
- [x] Mobile responsiveness maintained
- [x] Build process reliable and fast

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Lighthouse Performance score ≥ 95 (needs testing)
